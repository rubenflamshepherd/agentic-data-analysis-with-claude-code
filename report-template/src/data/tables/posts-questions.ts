  description: "Analysis of Stack Overflow's posts_questions table reveals key factors driving user reputation growth through question-asking behavior. The data shows that asking questions is not an efficient path to reputation growth for most users - 66% of questions receive zero votes, and only 0.4% achieve high scores (5+). However, certain patterns correlate with better outcomes: users who persist and ask more questions improve their per-question performance over time, suggesting a learning effect.",
